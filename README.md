"All-the-Feels Gif Generator!"

Using the GIPHY API, I created an interactive app that allows users to fill the page with emotions-based gifs. 

When the user clicks on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.

When the user clicks on the image, the gif plays. When they click again, the gif stops playing.

The user can add a new emotion button via the input the form, which will then be pushed to the array containing the other buttons, displayed on the page, and become a fully functional button.
